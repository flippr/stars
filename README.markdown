# stars
### you're so vain / you probably think these stars are about you

## why

Stars are a global currency. You tweet something, you write something, you
otherwise put yourself out there. Sure, you feel a warm sense of accomplishment
when you do this, but how do you *really* know if the people like you?

**FUCKING STARS, THAT'S HOW**

`stars` is a command-line client to check your precious stars at fine
establishments like [Twitter](http://twitter.com) (via the exquisite
[Favstar](http://favstar.fm)) and [Convore](http://convore.com). More services
will be added as they get added.

## how

Install with `gem install stars`, then do a quick `stars`, fill in your
username for your service, and let it do its sultry magic. This is me lately:

## BONUS ROUND

Plopped a whopper of a comparison on Convore between Python's whitespacing and
the piddly lawyer in Jurassic Park, and want to see the results *right now,
dammit??!??!?!?!*? Have no fear! Check your service stars directly with `stars
<service>`:

## whip it out

`stars` is kind of a silly little project. It's not as well-tested or
well-documented as I'd like, but so it goes. Fork, send me a pull request, and
we'll all be friends.

## who

[@holman](http://twitter.com/holman) did this. I look great in a Speedo.
